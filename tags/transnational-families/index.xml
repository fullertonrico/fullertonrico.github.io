      <title>Aging without a Safety Net: Challenges Faced by Unauthorized Immigrants at the End of Their Working Years</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Labor laws relegate unauthorized immigrants to low-paying jobs during their working years, while other laws exclude unauthorized immigrants from accessing safety-net institutions designed to support older people, such as Social Security or Medicare (Ayón et al. 2020; Flores Morales 2021; Stanley et al. 2020; Torres et al. 2016). This makes the transition out of work carry particular challenges not borne by other populations. At the same time, immigrants in this position describe economic struggles because they can no longer work due to bodily limitations and/or age discrimination, which complicates staying in the United States even if they would prefer to do so. How do older unauthorized immigrants navigate these pressures and uncertainties as their working years come to an end? How does ceasing to work challenge the identities of people defined and valued primarily as laborers in U.S. society –– and how are these challenges gendered? How do unauthorized immigrants plan for their futures and deal with uncertainty at this stage of life? What sources of formal and informal support are they able to access?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unos Allá, Otros Aquí: Transnational Parenting and Digital Communication across the Mexico-U.S. Border</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As border walls grow, security tightens, and arrests climb for undocumented migrants crossing the Mexico-U.S. border, physical visits have become increasingly difficult for families living on both sides. At the same time, communication technologies have improved and cheapened, so families are physically divided but digitally close. This paper examines how parents and children at younger and older ages navigate the juxtaposition of decades-long physical absence and near-daily communication as they work to maintain the bonds of family across the border. What is it like to migrate during a time marked by increasingly closed borders and increasingly open communication? More specifically, how do families separated by a border they cannot cross use technology to maintain relationships? Drawing on binational fieldwork with families straddling the Mexico-U.S. border, I find that immigrant parents often have children in both countries. As parents use technology to forge bonds of “digital siblinghood” between children who have never physically met and face the prospect of leaving behind some children to reunite with others, they fear that unifying their families may be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
