      <title>Feminist Interview Methods and Research Ethics</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Scholars have critiqued feminist ethnographic research methods because of their potential to create a false sense of friendship and intimacy or to downplay power differences, rather than acknowledging that unequal power dynamics cannot be completely eliminated (see, e.g., Kirsch 2005). Drawing on interviews and fieldwork conducted in the United States and Mexico between 2017–2020 on the subjects of transnational relationships and migration, this paper examines how to use interview methods to address unequal power dynamics and increase transparency. In doing research that uses participant-observation and semi-structured interviews, I find that interviews can be a powerful tool for ensuring participants understand what I am studying, setting clearer boundaries, and creating space for participants to shape my research agenda. Sharing my own experiences as an immigrant who maintains close transnational relationships also allows me to increase transparency about my social location and the ways it might limit my perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Grieving in the “Golden Cage”: How Unauthorized Immigrants Mourn from Afar</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;By tightening its borders and reducing opportunities for unauthorized immigrants to adjust their status, the United States has created a population of long-term unauthorized immigrants who are now transitioning into older ages. As the undocumented population ages, issues of death and dying are increasingly relevant to them and to their families. Though we know much about how families maintain social and emotional closeness despite geographic distance, death and dying remain undertheorized in transnational family scholarship. This is important because the death of a family member can significantly impact family structure and functions. Based on ethnographic and interview data collected between 2017–2022 with unauthorized Mexican immigrants and their families, this study examines how older undocumented immigrants grapple with the fear of transnational death before it impacts them, how individuals mourn from afar when people they love and rely on in their communities of origin die, and how transnational families are impacted by the death of one of their members, especially when that person played a vital role in maintaining transnational bonds. In addition to contributing to the literature on transnational families, this research advances immigration scholarship by highlighting underappreciated social and emotional penalties imposed by current immigration laws. This study also contributes to our understanding of the importance of death and bereavement by examining the consequences of being prevented from gathering to grieve.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Unos Allá, Otros Aquí: Transnational Parenting and Digital Communication across the Mexico-U.S. Border</title>
      <link>https://fullertonrico.github.io/research/unos-alla-otros-aqui-transnational-parenting-and-digital-communication-across-the-mexico-u.s.-border/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As border walls grow, security tightens, and arrests climb for undocumented migrants crossing the Mexico-U.S. border, physical visits have become increasingly difficult for families living on both sides. At the same time, communication technologies have improved and cheapened, so families are physically divided but digitally close. This paper examines how parents and children at younger and older ages navigate the juxtaposition of decades-long physical absence and near-daily communication as they work to maintain the bonds of family across the border. What is it like to migrate during a time marked by increasingly closed borders and increasingly open communication? More specifically, how do families separated by a border they cannot cross use technology to maintain relationships? Drawing on binational fieldwork with families straddling the Mexico-U.S. border, I find that immigrant parents often have children in both countries. As parents use technology to forge bonds of “digital siblinghood” between children who have never physically met and face the prospect of leaving behind some children to reunite with others, they fear that unifying their families may be impossible.&lt;/p&gt;
